    <p>My name is <b>Hyun Su Seong</b> or <b>Winfred</b>, a Canadian geographer (meteorologist) from Ontario. Thanks for visiting my online portfolio. I created this very minimalistic site to document my side projects and academic activities.</p>

    <p>My specialization is in:</p>
    <p><b style="color: crimson;"> Tropical Cyclones.</b> My master's research paper - <i style="color: crimson;">Impacts of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones on Major Airports in Florida 2010 â€“ 2017</i> - was focused on mathematical estimation of the power dissipation index of major hurricanes that struck Florida and the delay costs as a result for major airlines in that state. Hurricanes fascinate me because they are, in essence, a mysterious phenomena that is throwing a myriad of conundrums to geographers in terms of forecasting and its physical formation. I also focus on climate change, geocomputation with GIS, and cartography.</p>
    <p><b style="color: crimson;"> Avialinguistics.</b> Currently in my PhD I study language issues in aviation with human factors perspective. Aviation English - the lingua franca of the air - is becoming more complex as the demand for pilots increase worldwide. I've also focused previously on competency-based training and assessment (CBTA) and cognitive engineering.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, I bridge the gap between geography and human factors. This is a unique combination of knowledge which I use to analyze complex societal and environmental problems.</p>

    <p>Things I do in my leisure time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Painting: I love art, therefore I draw.</li>
        <li>Listening to Podcasts: For informing myself on climate change issues.</li>
        <li>Studying heraldry or vexillology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My LinkedIn profile can be accessed from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyun-su-winfred-seong-545bb467">here</a>. My GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/zorroartico"> zorroartico </a><b>[1]</b>.</p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>

    <p><strong>[1]</strong> A portfolio without a logo is boring. By the way, "zorroartico" translates to arctic fox in Spanish. Hence the logo for this portfolio. Alas, it doesn't look like a fox. It looks more like a <i>canine</i> than <i>vulpes</i>. Anyways, the animal is in a combative stance adorned with a skyblue necktie and a pair of wrinkled feather wings. The wings represent aeronautics background and the necktie stands for work ethic. Below the animal is a plaque showing my name in Hangul, but highly stylized.</p>
