    <p>My name is <b>Hyun Su Seong</b> or <b>Winfred</b>, a Canadian geographer (meteorologist) from Ontario. Thanks for visiting my online portfolio. I created this very minimalistic site to document my side projects and academic activities.</p>

    <p>I am a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My specialization is human factors and my research focuses on Aviation English and pilot-ATC miscommunication. My Master's was in Geography (Waterloo), in which I focused on the mathematical estimation of the strength of tropical cyclones (i.e. hurricanes). My undergrad was in Commercial Aviation Management (Western).</p>

    <p>I bridge the gap between geography and human factors. This is a unique combination of knowledge which I use to analyze complex societal and environmental problems.</p>

    <p>Things I do in my leisure time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Painting: I love art, therefore I draw.</li>
        <li>Listening to Podcasts: For informing myself on climate change issues.</li>
        <li>Studying heraldry or vexillology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My LinkedIn profile can be accessed from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyun-su-winfred-seong-545bb467">here</a>. My GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/zorroartico"> zorroartico </a><b>[1]</b>.</p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>

    <p><strong>[1]</strong> By the way, "zorroartico" translates to arctic fox in Spanish. Hence the logo for this portfolio. Alas, it doesn't look like a fox. It looks more like a <i>canine</i> than <i>vulpes</i>. Anyways, the animal is in a combative stance adorned with a skyblue necktie and a pair of wrinkled feather wings. The wings represent aeronautics background and the necktie stands for work ethic. Below the animal is a plaque showing my name in Hangul, but highly stylized.</p>
