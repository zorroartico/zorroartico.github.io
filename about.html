    <p>My name is <b>Hyun Su Seong</b> or <b>Winfred</b>, a Canadian geographer (meteorologist) from Ontario. Thanks for visiting my online portfolio. I created this very minimalistic site to document my side projects, work experiences, and academic activities.</p>

    <p>I am a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My specialization is human factors and my research focuses on Aviation English and pilot-ATC miscommunication. My Master's was in Geography (Waterloo), in which I focused on the mathematical estimation of the strength of tropical cyclones (i.e. hurricanes). My undergrad was in Commercial Aviation Management (Western).</p>

    <p>I bridge the gap between aviation, geography, and human factors. This is a unique combination of knowledge which I use to analyze complex societal and environmental problems.</p>
