  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <div class="div-center">

    <b>Q1. Do you take notes by hand or computer?</b>
    <p>It's a very important question. I always handwrite my notes. When writing notes on a computer, it's hard to focus on learning at the same time with all the typing noises.</p>

    <b>Q2. How important is coding in geography?</b>
    <p>I would say it's important. No matter you are in human or physical geography, learning coding would be practical. Suppose you have a database of volcanos that contain a pixelated raster information. You want to create a 3 by 3 (3 rows, 3 columns) data visualization out of it. Instead of making each raster map one by one using a GIS software, you can automate this process in a few lines of code. Keep learning how to code! Think of coding like this: It's not a necessary requirement, but a sufficient one for being a geographer.</p>

    <b>Q3. Who are your favourite scholars from the past?</b>
    <ul class="ul-normal">
      <li><b>Alexander von Humboldt</b>. A Prussian (German) geographer who laid foundations to today's botany and meteorology.</li>
      <li><b>Arthur Schopenhauer</b>. A German philosopher who viewed the world as irrational and that desire (such as a pride) is a driving force of insatiable striving.</li>
